## Concept

Sound Synthesist gives artists a promptable canvas: describe the vibe you want, and the system composes layered stems pulled from a curated sample graph. The interface exposes the generative logic so artists can remix, resample, or re-sequence without hitting a creative dead end.

## Approach

- Built a modular synthesis engine in TypeScript leveraging Web Audio nodes and lightweight DSP libraries.
- Used OpenAI function calling to translate text prompts into modulatable parameters (tempo, timbre, envelopes).
- Indexed public-domain stems with vector embeddings for timbral similarity.
- Designed controls to keep the human in the loop: every AI action surfaces the parameters it touched with quick undo.

## (Future) Live Demo

The live playground will return soon. Infrastructure hardening is underway so the demo can run with isolated credentials and rate limiting.

## Sources

- Public-domain jazz, orchestral, and ambient stems curated from Library of Congress collections.
- User research transcripts and prompt audit logs (anonymized) to continue tuning safety filters.

## What’s Next

- Ship the hardened live demo with offline-capable rendering.
- Release MIDI export and patch sharing.
- Open-source the prompt-to-parameter mapper for community contributions.
