## Problem

Legacy checkout flows were fragmented across three brands, requiring duplicate address entry and lacking personalization. Session drop-offs spiked at payment selection and cart review due to latency and unclear copy. The executive sponsor needed a scalable redesign that could support AI-driven offers without increasing compliance risk.

## Role

As the Senior AI Product Manager, I led discovery, requirements, and delivery across product, design, and engineering. I owned roadmap definition, AI experimentation strategy, and executive stakeholder updates while partnering with data science and compliance counterparts.

## Insights

- 62% of total delay surfaced between shipping and payment steps due to sequential API calls.
- Customers exposed to contextual financing suggestions converted at 1.8× the baseline.
- Mobile users abandoned at 2× the rate of desktop because form fields were not auto-formatting inputs.

## Strategy

We staged the initiative across three workstreams:

1. **Experience Core** — rebuild checkout with responsive design, inline validation, and accessibility baked in.
2. **AI Offer Engine** — orchestrate personalization via content slots controlled by experimentation toggles.
3. **Experimentation Pod** — establish governance, KPI tracking, and insight cadence to sustain iteration.

## Execution

- Introduced a single-page architecture with progressive disclosure and inline save states.
- Built a feature flag framework for AI-generated incentives, ensuring fallbacks existed for deterministic copy.
- Established instrumentation to pipe core KPIs into a combined Looker + Amplitude dashboard.
- Ran six sequential A/B tests covering copy, modular payment steps, and financing offer timing.
